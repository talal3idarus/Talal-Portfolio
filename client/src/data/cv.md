## Projects

### 1. AI-Driven Student Code Clustering & Feedback System
**Role:** AI Developer & Research Co-Author  
**Technologies:** Python, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, HDBSCAN, AST Analysis

This system uses AI-based clustering and semantic code analysis to evaluate SQL programming submissions. It automates feedback generation and scoring, significantly reducing manual grading while ensuring fairness and consistency. The project was presented at the IEEE International Conference 2025 in Penang, Malaysia, and was awarded Best Conference Paper. It reflects my work at the intersection of AI, education, and ethical software assessment.

### 2. Pathfinder: IT Career Guidance System
**Role:** Lead Developer & System Designer  
**Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Decision Trees, KNN, Firebase

Pathfinder is a web-based AI system that helps high school students (ages 15‚Äì18) identify the most suitable IT careers based on their skills, interests, hobbies, and academic strengths. The system operates in two phases: eligibility evaluation and career recommendation using machine learning models. This project highlights my interest in career development, decision support systems, and educational technology.

### 3. Aqua Sink Pro: Smart Water Heater System
**Role:** Embedded Systems Developer & App Developer  
**Technologies:** IoT, Mobile App Development, Firebase, C++, Android

Aqua Sink Pro is a smart IoT device that allows remote control and monitoring of water heaters, integrating advanced safety and energy-saving features. Developed as part of the E-Zone competition and later published at an IEEE-affiliated conference, the project includes mobile app functionality, real-time temperature readings, and automated shutdown mechanisms. It received the Best Research Paper Award at SITER 2024 in India.

### 4. The Original Prices: Price Comparison App
**Role:** Full-Stack Mobile Developer  
**Technologies:** Flutter, Dart, Firebase, Web Scraping (planned), Google Maps API (planned)

This app helps consumers compare real product prices across multiple stores, addressing misleading discount practices. Built with Flutter for cross-platform use and Firebase for backend services, the project will include barcode scanning, map-based store search, and crowdsourced price reviews. It demonstrates my focus on building transparent and consumer-friendly digital tools.

### 5. Home Grocery: Family Shopping Platform
**Role:** Full-Stack Web Developer  
**Technologies:** React.js, JavaScript, Firebase, CSS

Home Grocery is a simple yet effective platform for families to manage shared grocery lists. It features secure login, live updates, search, and filtering to streamline household shopping. Designed and built in 1.5 days, it reflects my ability to quickly deliver functional products with clean UI. Planned updates include in-app notifications, barcode scanning, personal lists, and a family chat system.

### 6. UTAS-hub: Course Summary Platform
**Role:** Full-Stack Developer  
**Technologies:** React.js, Firebase, JavaScript, CSS

UTAS-hub is a comprehensive course summary platform serving over 3,000+ students across UTAS branches. It centralizes academic resources, course materials, and study guides, enabling efficient access and organization.

**Key Features:**
- Course material organization and categorization
- Search functionality across all resources
- User authentication and personalized dashboards
- Real-time updates and notifications
- Mobile-responsive design
